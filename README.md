Description: We all are fond of travelling especially myself. While surfing over the internet, I found different sites like Goibibo, Yatra etc where you choose your destination, how many passengers are there and all and aftyer submitting, you ar done. So, I also tried to make a tours and travels website named as "JetSetGo" with the functionalities of choosing a destination, browse through the packages, login to register and many more.

TechStacks used: (a)HTML
                 (b)CSS
                 (c)JavaScript

Reason behind choosing the project: Travelling plays an important role in our life. It not only changes your mood bu also it helps you to know the speciality of a place, their peoples, their cultures and many more. I have choosen this project because I have a friedn who is very close to me and owns an tour and travelling shop. So, to help him and to spread his business from local to global, I have tried this website design which I think help him to identify himself after got hosted on a particular domain.
